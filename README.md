Giving udapeople company deployment automation superpowers.

### I am still working on several issues as of 7-25-2021 @9:15 PM.
I have the following Rubrics from the project complete:
* Presentation.pdf
* URL01.txt
* SCREENSHOT01.JPG
* SCREENSHOT02.JPG
* SCREENSHOT03.JPG
* SCREENSHOT04.JPG
* SCREENSHOT05.JPG
* SCREENSHOT06.JPG
* SCREENSHOT07.JPG
* SCREENSHOT08.JPG

But I am still working on the remaining sections.
I do have prometheus up and running, but still getting errors on my ansible deploy for alertmanager to the other AWS servers.
I have requested an extension for the project, but I am turning in what I have now so that you can see I am working on it still.
